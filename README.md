Android TV Plugin for Cordova
==============================

Cordova plugin to add support for Android TV to your project's AndroidManifest.xml.

Install
-------

`cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-android-tv`

This plugin expects banner image to be present in @drawable/banner which for cordova-android < 7.0.0 resolves to platforms/android/res/drawable/banner.png. You need to somehow copy the banner into this directory after "cordova platform add android" but before "cordova build android".
